# Intel 8051 Microprocessor Assembler

Low-level, Intel 8051 Assembler Programs made for an university course in early 2018.

## Brief description

Well, it sucks, but instead of x86 or ARM processors, at my university we use outdated and **only-one-in-its-amazing-class Intel 8051**.
[Here you can get instruction set](http://www.zsk.ict.pwr.wroc.pl/zsk/repository/dydaktyka/ptm/lab/8051instrset.pdf) but I doubt anyone would like to do that.
